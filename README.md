## DE Project

This is a project that a few of my friends and I worked on during our time at college as part of the Design Engineering curriculum (under GTU).

Essentially, this project is a Node app that uses:
- An Express server for the backend.
- MongoDB as the database.
- Handlebars for server-side rendering of the pages.
- HTML5 and CSS3 for the webpages.

### Use Case:

This app was inspired by a situation that occurred during our college days. My friends and I used to commute to college every day, and one day, one of my friend's wallets got stolen!

So we thought, why not take this opportunity to create something that could help someone who finds the wallet and possibly contact us?

Thus, we decided to build a web app that generates a QR code, which leads to a webpage displaying contact details that can be used to reach us.

At that time (2021), Apple AirTags weren’t available to solve this problem, and they were quite expensive for the technology they offered (not that we’re complaining—they're awesome, just not affordable for everyone).

So, here’s how it works: You sign up for the app, add your contact details, and generate a QR code linked to your account. You can then attach the code to your belongings, like your wallet, bag, or folders.

Whenever someone scans the QR code, you’ll receive an email notifying you that the code was scanned. The person who scanned it will also get your contact details. At the time, we were a bit naïve about leaving the contact details open like that.

That’s it!
