## DE Project

A project that I and a couple of my buds made during our days at the college under the curriculum of Design Engineering (under GTU).

Basically, this project is a Node app using:
- An Express server as the backend.
- MongoDB as the database.
- Handlebars for server-side rendering the pages.
- And, the webpages were made using HTML5 and CSS3.

### The use-case of this app:
This app was made by a situation that occurred to us during the college days. Me and my buds used to commute daily to the college and one day one of my bud's wallet got stolen!

So we thought, why not take this opportunity to make something that might help someone who can later find the wallet and maybe contact us back?

And thus, we decided to make a web app that can generate a QR code that can show a web page to whoever scans it and show them a contact that they can use to contact us. 

There were no Apple AirTags at that time (2021) to solve this issue and it does cost a lot for the piece of tech it is (not complaining. it's awesome though, just not affordable for everyone).

So yeah, you just sign up to the app and add your contact details and generate a QR code for your account.
You can stick that code to any of your belongings like your wallet, bag, folders, etc.

Whenever someone scans the QR code, you get a mail that your code was scanned by someone and the person who scanned it gets your contact details. We were kind of naive to leave the contact details open then.

That's it!
Thanks for visiting and reading!
